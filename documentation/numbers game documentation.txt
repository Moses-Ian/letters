There are two key states to keep track of:
numbersArr and operationArr

numbersArr is an array of six objects. Each object has two properties:
number: a string
disabled: a boolean

number is used to set the text of its associated button.
disabled is used to set whether the button is disabled.

you set numbersArr using the setNumbersArr and its associated reducer.

numbersReducer takes an action object. That object's properties are:
type: (required) a string. can be PUSH, DISABLE, ENABLE, ENABLE_ALL, or RENDER_NUMBERS
numberObj: (if type is PUSH) an object, defined as above (with the properties number and disabled)
index: (if type is PUSH, DISABLE, or ENABLE) an integer 0 to 5.
numbersArr: (if type is RENDER_NUMBERS) a numbersArr, as defined above

PUSH sets the numberObj at the given index value to the given numberObj
DISABLE sets the numberObj at the given index value to true
ENABLE sets the numberObj at the given index value to false
ENABLE_ALL sets all of the numberObj to false
RENDER_NUMBERS sets the numbersArr to the given numbersArr

operationArr is an array of strings

operationArr is displayed by joining the array with operationArr.join(' ')

you set operationArr using the setOperationArr function and its associated reducer.

operationReducer takes an action object. That object's properties are:
type: (required) a string. can be PUSH or CLEAR
operation: (if type is PUSH) a string. should be a number or one of +-*/()
operation: (if type is PUSH_ALL) an operationArr. will automatically add parentheses

PUSH adds an operation to the operationArr
PUSH_ALL adds a set of operations to the operationArr
CLEAR sets the operationArr to an empty, zero length array
